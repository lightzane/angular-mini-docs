# Latest Published Date

Sorting priority:

1. `index`
2. `published_date`
3. `filename`

> This file contains only `published_date`

<!-- truncate -->

This file does not contain any `index` value.

But this has `published_date` and has the **most latest date** in the entire `documents` but still it will never be displayed at the top of the list since some other file has an `index` field. (**1** being the highest priority)
